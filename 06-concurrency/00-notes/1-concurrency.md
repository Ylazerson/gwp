### Concurrency

**Parallel** programs that have to run tasks at the same time will need the environment variable `GOMAXPROCS` to be set to more than 1. Since Go 1.5, `GOMAXPROCS` is set to the number of CPUs available in the system. 

**Concurrent** programs can run within a single CPU and tasks scheduled to run independently. 

Whatâ€™s important to note now is that although Go can be used to create parallel programs, **it was created with concurrency in mind and not parallelism**.

Go's support for concurrency is supported by two main constructs:
1. `goroutines` 
2. `channels`.
